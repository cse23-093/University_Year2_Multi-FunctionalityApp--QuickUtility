# Univesity_Year2_Multi-FunctionalityApp--QuickUtility
My code is in my Master branch. As part of our coursework, we were assigned to develop an Android app using Kotlin with segmented functionalities.A calculator, a unit converter, flash events, and a calendar are the four main elements of the QuickUtility software. We built the app using Android Studio, making sure it complied with the specifications or higher set at our school lab, namely Android Studio 7, Gradle 4.10.0, SDK version 26 or higher, build tool version 24.0.3, and the Android virtual machine Nexus 5 Android 6.0 API23. When the application is closed, all user-inputted data is deleted because it is not permanently stored.
